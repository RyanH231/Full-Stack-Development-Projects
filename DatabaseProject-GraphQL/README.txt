Purpose: This project can be used to maintain an ongoing list of books and authors (perhaps for favourite books, or for books that
the user has read etc.).

Technology: This project incorporates GraphQL to make queries to the database, and the database is established through MongoDB
and Mongoose. The client side of the project incorporates the React JSX library, and the Apollo Client for making requests to 
GraphQL.
